Download raw MxIF data from the HTAN Data Coordinating Center Data Portal at the National Cancer Institute: [https://data.humantumoratlas.org/](https://data.humantumoratlas.org/) (HTAN Vanderbilt Atlas) and place it in a directory called `MxIF/` here. Then, start from `step1` analysis.

In order to skip to `step7` IEX analysis, you may download the `MxIF/quantification/` directory and place contents in the `MxIF/` subdirectory here.
